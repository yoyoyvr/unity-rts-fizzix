Experiments with the interaction of physics and waypoint-based unit navigation.

Physics looks cool, but doesn't necessarily respect unit tunings for speed, turning
radius, stopping distance, etc. This project is a Unity sandbox to explore the combination
of Unity's rigid-body physics with tunable unit behaviours, as one would want in an
RTS game. Will also be used to explore the notion of making AI code independent of
the Unity engine.
