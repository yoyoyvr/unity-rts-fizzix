Experiments with the interaction of physics and waypoint-based vehicle navigation.

Physics looks cool, but doesn't necessarily respect unit tunings for speed, turning
radius, stopping distance, etc. This project is a Unity sandbox to explore the combination
of Unity's rigid-body physics with tunable unit behaviours, as one would want in an
RTS game.
